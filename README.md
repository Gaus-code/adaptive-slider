# adaptive-slider
## responsive js slider layout
To implement the slider, I used a layout from Figma (link attached below), Saas preprocesses (scss) and pure js
* from 3 to 7 slides can participate in the scroll at the same time
* each slide has its own title, text (with line breaks), image, button text and button link
* the slider control is dots and arrows(in the desktop version)
* the slider control is dots (in the tablet and mobile version)
* slides change automatically every 5 seconds
* slides change endlessly in a circle
